WarningNotification:
	'''
	Hey there, here's a bit you should know before playing our mod!
	This mod ONLY adds compatibility with FARGO'S.
	If there is a bug, balancing issue, or anything of the sort related to two mods, DO NOT report it in the discord server.
	For example: If Homeward Journey and Spirit have an incompatibility, this mod will NOT fix it, that's up to the main devs.
	However, if there is an issue with Fargos and Homeward journey, this mod WILL fix it.
	After you have acknowledged this, there is a config you can turn off so you don't get this message anymore.
